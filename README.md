The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate a One-Class SVM's ability to accurately classify malicious TLS traffic. This repository is supplied as a part of a presentation for a research assignment in support of my Master's of Science in Information Security Engineering from SANS Technology Institute entitled Finding Malware in Encrypted TLS Traffic. The associated paper ***Malware Detection in Encrypted TLS Traffic Through Machine Learning*** is available as a part of the parent repository linked below.
